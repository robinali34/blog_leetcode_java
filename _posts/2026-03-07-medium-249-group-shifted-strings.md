We can "shift" a string by shifting each character to its successive character (with `z` wrapping to `a`). For example, `"abc"` can be shifted to `"bcd"`, ..., `"xyz"`, `"yza"`, `"zab"`.

Given an array of strings, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strings = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]
Output: [["acef"],["a","z"],["abc","bcd","xyz"],["az","ba"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strings = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= strings.length <= 200`
- `1 <= strings[i].length <= 50`
- `strings[i]` consists of lowercase English letters

## Thinking Process

Two strings belong to the same shift group if their **consecutive character differences** are identical. For example:

```
"abc": b-a=1, c-b=1  → key: "1,1,"
"bcd": c-b=1, d-c=1  → key: "1,1,"  ← same group
"xyz": y-x=1, z-y=1  → key: "1,1,"  ← same group
```

The wrapping case: `"az"` and `"ba"`:

```
"az": z-a = 25       → key: "25,"
"ba": a-b = -1 → +26 = 25  → key: "25,"  ← same group
```

### Canonical Form

For each string, compute the difference between consecutive characters modulo 26. This difference sequence is the **canonical key** -- strings with the same key belong to the same group.

Use `(str[i] - str[i-1] + 26) % 26` to handle the wrap-around from `z` to `a`.

## Approach: Difference Key Hashing -- $O(n \cdot k)$

{% raw %}
```java
class Solution {
    vector<String[]> groupStrings(String[] strings) {
        unordered_map<String, String[]> hm;

        for (String str : strings) {
            public String key;
            for (int i = 1; i < (int)str.size(); i++) {
                int diff = (str[i] - str[i - 1] + 26) % 26;
                key += to_string(diff) + ",";
            }
            hm[key].push_back(str);
        }

        vector<String[]> rtn;
        for (auto& [key, strs] : hm)
            rtn.add(strs);

        return rtn;
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(n \cdot k)$ where $n$ is the number of strings and $k$ is the average string length
**Space**: $O(n \cdot k)$ for the map

## Why `+26` Before `%26`?

In Java, the `%` operator can return negative values for negative operands. For example, `'a' - 'z' = -25`, and `-25 % 26 = -25` (implementation-defined but typically negative). Adding 26 first ensures the result is always in `[0, 25]`.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting the `+26` before `%26` -- negative differences break the key
- Not using a separator in the key -- `"1,12,"` vs `"11,2,"` would collide without separators
- Single-character strings: they all share the empty key `""` and correctly group together

## Key Takeaways

- This is a **"group by canonical form"** problem, same pattern as [LC 49 Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) and [LC 893 Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings](/2026/02/15/easy-893-groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/)
- The canonical form here is the **difference sequence** rather than sorted characters
- Always use a separator when building composite keys from numbers to avoid collisions
