Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, merge them by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If one string is longer, append the remaining letters at the end.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: a p b q c r
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: a p b q + remaining "rs"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: a p b q + remaining "cd"
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters

## Thinking Process

Use two pointers `i` and `j` to walk through both strings simultaneously. In each iteration, take one character from `word1` (if available), then one from `word2` (if available). The loop continues until both strings are exhausted, naturally handling unequal lengths.

## Solution: Two Pointers -- $O(m + n)$

{% raw %}
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.size(), n = word2.size();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        String rtn;
        rtn.reserve(m + n);

        while (i < m || j < n) {
            if (i < m) {
                rtn += word1[i++];
            }
            if (j < n) {
                rtn += word2[j++];
            }
        }
        return rtn;
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(m + n)$
**Space**: $O(1)$ auxiliary (output excluded)

## Key Details

**`reserve(m + n)`**: Pre-allocates the result string to avoid reallocations during appending. Not required for correctness but good practice.

**`||` not `&&`**: Using `||` in the loop condition ensures we keep going until *both* strings are done. With `&&` we'd stop at the shorter string and lose the remaining characters.

## Common Mistakes

- Using `&&` instead of `||` in the while condition (truncates the longer string)
- Appending both characters unconditionally without checking bounds

## Key Takeaways

- Simple two-pointer merge pattern -- the same idea behind merging two sorted arrays
- The `if` guards inside the loop elegantly handle unequal lengths without separate tail-appending logic
