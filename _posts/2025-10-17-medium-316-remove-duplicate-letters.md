# [Medium] 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the **smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
Explanation: 
- Remove duplicate 'b' and 'c'
- Result "abc" is lexicographically smallest
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
Explanation: 
- Remove duplicate 'c' and 'b'
- Result "acdb" is lexicographically smallest
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "bbcaac"
Output: "bac"
Explanation: 
- Remove duplicate 'b' and 'c'
- Result "bac" is lexicographically smallest
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Duplicate removal**: How should we remove duplicates? (Assumption: Remove duplicate letters so each letter appears at most once)

2. **Lexicographic order**: What does "lexicographically smallest" mean? (Assumption: Smallest in dictionary order - 'a' < 'b', 'ab' < 'ac')

3. **Character preservation**: Can we reorder characters? (Assumption: Must maintain relative order of remaining characters - cannot completely rearrange)

4. **Return format**: What should we return? (Assumption: String with duplicates removed, lexicographically smallest possible)

5. **All unique**: What if string has no duplicates? (Assumption: Return string as is - already optimal)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to remove duplicates. Let me try all possible ways to remove characters."

**Naive Solution**: Try all possible ways to remove duplicate characters, check which gives lexicographically smallest result.

**Complexity**: Exponential time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Exponential time complexity
- Tries many invalid combinations
- Very inefficient
- Doesn't leverage greedy property

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use greedy approach. For each position, choose lexicographically smallest character that can be placed."

**Improved Solution**: Use greedy with frequency counting. Count character frequencies. For each position, try placing smallest possible character that still allows remaining characters to be placed.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Greedy approach is correct
- O(n²) time is better than exponential
- Handles lexicographic ordering
- Can be optimized further

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "I can use monotonic stack to efficiently maintain lexicographic order while ensuring all characters are included."

**Best Solution**: Use monotonic stack with frequency counting. Track character frequencies and whether character is in stack. For each character, while stack top is larger and can be removed (frequency > 0), pop it. Push current character.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space (26 characters)

**Key Realizations**:
1. Monotonic stack maintains lexicographic order
2. Frequency counting ensures all characters included
3. O(n) time is optimal - single pass
4. O(1) space - fixed alphabet size

## Solution: Monotonic Stack with Greedy Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of string  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) since we use at most 26 characters

Use a monotonic stack to maintain lexicographically smallest result while ensuring each character appears exactly once.

```java
// import java.util.*;
class Solution {
        public String removeDuplicateLetters(String s) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        public boolean[] visited = new boolean[26];
        Deque<char> st = new ArrayDeque<>();

        // Count frequency of each character
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']--;

            // Skip if already in result
            if(visited[c - 'a']) continue;

            // Remove characters that are:
            // 1. Greater than current character
            // 2. Will appear again later
            while(!st.isEmpty() && st.peek() > c && count[st.peek() - 'a'] > 0) {
                visited[st.peek() - 'a'] = false;
                st.poll();
            }

            st.offer(c);
            visited[c - 'a'] = true;
        }

        String result;
        while(!st.isEmpty()) {
            result = st.peek() + result;
            st.poll();
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## How the Algorithm Works

**Key Insight:** Use a monotonic stack to maintain lexicographically smallest result while ensuring each character appears exactly once.

**Steps:**
1. **Count frequency** of each character in the string
2. **Use visited array** to track characters already in result
3. **For each character:**
   - Skip if already processed
   - Remove characters from stack that are:
     - Greater than current character (lexicographically)
     - Will appear again later (count > 0)
4. **Add current character** to stack and mark as visited
5. **Build result** from stack

## Step-by-Step Example

### Example: `s = "cbacdcbc"`

**Initial state:**
- `count = [2,2,2,1]` (a=2, b=2, c=2, d=1)
- `visited = [false,false,false,false]`
- `stack = []`

**Processing each character:**

| Char | Count After | Visited | Stack Operation | Stack State |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| 'c' | [2,2,1,1] | [f,f,t,f] | Push 'c' | ['c'] |
| 'b' | [2,1,1,1] | [f,t,t,f] | Push 'b' | ['c','b'] |
| 'a' | [1,1,1,1] | [t,t,t,f] | Pop 'b','c', Push 'a' | ['a'] |
| 'c' | [1,1,0,1] | [t,t,t,f] | Skip (already visited) | ['a'] |
| 'd' | [1,1,0,0] | [t,t,t,t] | Push 'd' | ['a','d'] |
| 'c' | [1,1,0,0] | [t,t,t,t] | Skip (already visited) | ['a','d'] |
| 'b' | [1,0,0,0] | [t,t,t,t] | Skip (already visited) | ['a','d'] |
| 'c' | [0,0,0,0] | [t,t,t,t] | Skip (already visited) | ['a','d'] |

**Final result:** `"acdb"`

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Core Logic:
```java
for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
    count[c - 'a']--;

    // Skip if already in result
    if(visited[c - 'a']) continue;

    // Remove characters that are:
    // 1. Greater than current character
    // 2. Will appear again later
    while(!st.isEmpty() && st.peek() > c && count[st.peek() - 'a'] > 0) {
        visited[st.peek() - 'a'] = false;
        st.poll();
    }

    st.offer(c);
    visited[c - 'a'] = true;
}
```

**Process:**
1. **Decrement count** for current character
2. **Skip if already processed** (visited)
3. **Remove larger characters** that will appear again
4. **Add current character** to stack
5. **Mark as visited**

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Count frequency | O(n) | O(1) |
| Process characters | O(n) | O(1) |
| Stack operations | O(n) | O(1) |
| Build result | O(n) | O(1) |
| **Total** | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |

Where n is the length of the string.

## Edge Cases

1. **Single character:** `s = "a"` → `"a"`
2. **All same characters:** `s = "aaaa"` → `"a"`
3. **Already sorted:** `s = "abc"` → `"abc"`
4. **Reverse sorted:** `s = "cba"` → `"abc"`

## Key Insights

### Greedy Strategy:
1. **Lexicographically smallest:** Always prefer smaller characters
2. **One occurrence:** Each character appears exactly once
3. **Future availability:** Consider if character will appear again
4. **Stack property:** Maintains order and allows efficient removal

### Monotonic Stack:
1. **Maintains order:** Characters in lexicographical order
2. **Efficient removal:** Can remove multiple characters at once
3. **Future consideration:** Checks if characters will appear again
4. **Optimal result:** Ensures smallest lexicographical order

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

### Example: `s = "bcabc"`

**Initial state:**
- `count = [1,2,2]` (a=1, b=2, c=2)
- `visited = [false,false,false]`
- `stack = []`

**Processing each character:**

| Char | Count After | Visited | Stack Operation | Stack State | Explanation |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| 'b' | [1,1,2] | [f,t,f] | Push 'b' | ['b'] | First 'b', add to stack |
| 'c' | [1,1,1] | [f,t,t] | Push 'c' | ['b','c'] | First 'c', add to stack |
| 'a' | [0,1,1] | [t,t,t] | Pop 'c','b', Push 'a' | ['a'] | 'a' < 'c','b', and 'c','b' will appear again |
| 'b' | [0,0,1] | [t,t,t] | Skip (already visited) | ['a'] | 'b' already in result |
| 'c' | [0,0,0] | [t,t,t] | Skip (already visited) | ['a'] | 'c' already in result |

**Final result:** `"abc"`

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Recursive with Backtracking
```java
class Solution {
        public String removeDuplicateLetters(String s) {
        if(s.length == 0) return "";

        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) count[c - 'a']++;
        int pos = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if(s.charAt(i) < s.charAt(pos)) pos = i;
            if(--count[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 0) break;
        }

        char c = s.charAt(pos);
        String remaining = s.substring(pos + 1);
        for(char ch : remaining) {
            if(ch == c) ch = ' ';
        }

        return c + removeDuplicateLetters(remaining);
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Approach 2: Set-based Approach
```java
// import java.util.*;
// import java.util.Arrays;
// import java.util.Collections;
class Solution {
        public String removeDuplicateLetters(String s) {
        TreeSet<char> seen = new TreeSet<>();
        String result;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if(seen.find(c) == seen.iterator()) {
                seen.add(c);
                result += c;
            }
        }

        Arrays.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong removal condition:** Not checking if character will appear again
2. **Missing visited check:** Processing same character multiple times
3. **Incorrect stack order:** Not maintaining lexicographical order
4. **Count management:** Not properly decrementing counts
