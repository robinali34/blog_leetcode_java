# [Medium] 62. Unique Paths

This is a classic dynamic programming problem that requires finding the number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right of a grid. The key insight is recognizing the overlapping subproblems and using DP to avoid recalculating the same paths multiple times.

## Problem Description

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

### Constraints
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Movement direction**: In which directions can we move? (Assumption: Only right and down - typical grid path problem constraint)

2. **Starting/ending positions**: Where do we start and end? (Assumption: Start at top-left (0,0), end at bottom-right (m-1, n-1))

3. **Path uniqueness**: Do we need to find all paths or just count them? (Assumption: Just count the number of unique paths, not enumerate them)

4. **Grid boundaries**: Can we move outside the grid? (Assumption: No - must stay within grid bounds)

5. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Number of unique paths - integer count)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to count paths. Let me try all possible paths using DFS/backtracking."

**Naive Solution**: Use DFS/backtracking to explore all possible paths from start to end, count successful paths.

**Complexity**: O(2^(m+n)) worst case time, O(m+n) space

**Issues**:
- Exponential time complexity
- Explores many redundant paths
- Very inefficient for large grids
- Doesn't leverage optimal substructure

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "This has optimal substructure. I can use dynamic programming - paths to (i,j) = paths to (i-1,j) + paths to (i,j-1)."

**Improved Solution**: DP where dp[i][j] = number of paths to reach (i,j). dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]. Base case: dp[0][0] = 1.

**Complexity**: O(m × n) time, O(m × n) space

**Improvements**:
- Polynomial time instead of exponential
- Correctly counts all paths
- Can optimize space to O(min(m,n))

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "DP is optimal. Can optimize space to O(n) using single row, or use combinatorial formula."

**Best Solution**: DP approach is optimal. Can optimize space to O(min(m,n)) using single array. Alternatively, use combinatorial formula: C(m+n-2, m-1) = (m+n-2)! / ((m-1)! × (n-1)!) but DP is more intuitive.

**Complexity**: O(m × n) time, O(min(m,n)) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. DP is natural approach - optimal substructure
2. O(m × n) time is optimal for DP approach
3. Space can be optimized to O(min(m,n))
4. Combinatorial formula exists but DP is clearer

## Approach

The solution uses dynamic programming with the following key insights:

1. **Base Case**: The first row and first column can only be reached in one way (moving right or down respectively)
2. **Recurrence Relation**: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`
3. **Bottom-up DP**: Build the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones

## Solution in Java

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n) - We fill each cell once  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n) - For the DP table

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp(m, int[](n, 1));
        for (int row = 1; row < m; row++) {
            for (int col = 1; col < n; col++) {
                dp[row][col] = dp[row][col - 1] + dp[row - 1][col];
            }
        }
        return dp[m- 1][n -1];
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the solution with m = 3, n = 3:

**Step 1:** Initialize DP table with all 1s
```
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
```

**Step 2:** Fill the DP table using recurrence relation
- dp[1][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[0][1] = 1 + 1 = 2
- dp[1][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[0][2] = 2 + 1 = 3
- dp[2][1] = dp[2][0] + dp[1][1] = 1 + 2 = 3
- dp[2][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[1][2] = 3 + 3 = 6

**Final DP table:**
```
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3, 6]
```

**Result:** dp[2][2] = 6 unique paths

## Key Insights

1. **Mathematical Approach**: This is essentially a combination problem - we need to choose (m-1) down moves out of (m+n-2) total moves
2. **DP Optimization**: Avoids recalculating the same subproblems multiple times
3. **Space Optimization**: Can be optimized to O(min(m,n)) space using rolling array technique
4. **Base Cases**: First row and column are always 1 since there's only one way to reach them

## Alternative Approaches

### Mathematical Solution (Combinatorics)
```java
static int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(m-1, n-1); i++) {
        result = result * (m + n - 2 - i) / (i + 1);
    }
    return (int)result;
}
```

### Space-Optimized DP
```java
static int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    int[] dp = new int[n];
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[j] += dp[j-1];
        }
    }
    return dp[n-1];
}
```

## Visual Representation

For a 3×3 grid, the unique paths are:
```
Start → → ↓
        ↓ ↓
        ↓ End

Start → ↓ ↓
        → ↓
        ↓ End

Start → ↓ ↓
        ↓ →
        ↓ End

Start ↓ → ↓
      → ↓
      ↓ End

Start ↓ → ↓
      ↓ →
      ↓ End

Start ↓ ↓ →
      ↓ ↓
      → End
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Off-by-one errors**: Confusing 0-indexed vs 1-indexed arrays
- **Integer overflow**: Not handling large numbers properly
- **Base case errors**: Not initializing first row and column correctly
- **Index confusion**: Mixing up row and column indices
