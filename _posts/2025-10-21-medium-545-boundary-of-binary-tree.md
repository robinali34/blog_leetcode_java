# LC 545: Boundary of Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Tree, DFS, Binary Tree  
**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in **anti-clockwise direction** starting from root. Boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order without duplicate nodes.

**Left boundary** is defined as the path from root to the left-most node. If the root doesn't have a left subtree, then the left boundary is empty.

**Right boundary** is defined as the path from root to the right-most node. If the root doesn't have a right subtree, then the right boundary is empty.

**Left-most node** is the leaf node you reach when you always travel to the left subtree if it exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Stop when you reach a leaf node.

**Right-most node** is the leaf node you reach when you always travel to the right subtree if it exists. If not, travel to the left subtree. Stop when you reach a leaf node.

**Leaf nodes** are nodes that don't have any children.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,4,2]
Explanation:
- The left boundary is empty because the root doesn't have a left child.
- The right boundary follows the path 1 -> 2 -> 4.
- The leaves from left to right are 3, 4.
- The anti-clockwise boundary is [1,3,4,2].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10]
Output: [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
Explanation:
- The left boundary follows the path 1 -> 2 -> 4.
- The right boundary follows the path 1 -> 3 -> 6.
- The leaves from left to right are 4, 7, 8, 9, 10.
- The anti-clockwise boundary is [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Boundary definition**: What is the boundary? (Assumption: Left boundary (top to bottom), leaves (left to right), right boundary (bottom to top) - anti-clockwise)

2. **Left boundary**: What is the left boundary? (Assumption: Path from root to leftmost node, excluding leaves)

3. **Right boundary**: What is the right boundary? (Assumption: Path from rightmost node to root, excluding leaves and root)

4. **Return format**: What should we return? (Assumption: List of node values in boundary order - anti-clockwise)

5. **Empty tree**: What if tree is empty? (Assumption: Return empty list - no boundary)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Traverse the tree three times: first pass to collect left boundary (excluding leaves), second pass to collect all leaves, third pass to collect right boundary (excluding leaves and root, in reverse order). Combine the three lists. This approach works but requires multiple traversals and careful handling of duplicates (root appears in left boundary, leaves might appear in boundaries).

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use a single DFS traversal with flags to identify boundary nodes: mark nodes as left boundary, right boundary, or leaf during traversal. However, identifying leftmost and rightmost nodes requires tracking the path and comparing positions, which adds complexity. We still need to handle duplicates carefully.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Separate the problem into three parts: (1) Left boundary: traverse from root following left children, if no left child follow right child, stop at leaf. (2) Leaves: use DFS to collect all leaves in left-to-right order. (3) Right boundary: traverse from root following right children, if no right child follow left child, stop at leaf, then reverse the list. Combine the three parts, ensuring no duplicates (root appears once, leaves appear once, right boundary excludes root and leaves). This achieves O(n) time with O(h) space for recursion, which is optimal. The key insight is that we can solve each part independently and combine them, avoiding complex boundary detection logic.

## Solution Approach

### Key Insight

The boundary traversal consists of three parts in order:
1. **Left boundary**: Root → leftmost node (excluding leaves)
2. **Leaves**: All leaf nodes from left to right
3. **Right boundary**: Rightmost node → root (excluding leaves, in reverse order)

### Approach: Three-Step Boundary Traversal

**Algorithm:**
1. Add root to result (if not a leaf)
2. Traverse left boundary (excluding leaves)
3. Traverse all leaves from left to right
4. Traverse right boundary (excluding leaves, in reverse order)

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(h) where h is height of tree

```java
class Solution {
    public int[]boundaryOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(!root) return rtn;
        rtn.add(root.val);
        getleft(root.left);
        getleaf(root.left);
        getleaf(root.right);
        getright(root.right);
        return rtn;
    }
    int[]rtn;

    void getleft(TreeNode node) {
        if(!node || (!node.left && !node.right)) return;
        rtn.add(node.val);
        if(!node.left) getleft(node.right);
        else getleft(node.left);
    }

    void getleaf(TreeNode node) {
        if(!node) return;
        getleaf(node.left);
        if(!node.left && !node.right) rtn.add(node.val);
        getleaf(node.right);
    }

    void getright(TreeNode node) {
        if(!node || (!node.left && !node.right)) return;
        if(!node.right) getright(node.left);
        else getright(node.right);
        rtn.add(node.val);
    }
}
```

### Alternative Approach: Single Pass with Flags

**Algorithm:**
1. Use flags to track if a node is on left boundary, right boundary, or is a leaf
2. Traverse the tree once and collect nodes based on flags
3. Handle special cases for root and single-node trees

```java
class Solution {
    public int[]boundaryOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        int[]result;
        if(!root) return result;

        result.add(root.val);

        // Get left boundary (excluding root and leaves)
        getLeftBoundary(root.left, result);

        // Get all leaves
        getLeaves(root, result);

        // Get right boundary (excluding root and leaves)
        getRightBoundary(root.right, result);

        return result;
    }
    void getLeftBoundary(TreeNode node, int[] result) {
        if(!node || (!node.left && !node.right)) return;

        result.add(node.val);

        if(node.left) {
            getLeftBoundary(node.left, result);
        } else {
            getLeftBoundary(node.right, result);
        }
    }

    void getLeaves(TreeNode node, int[] result) {
        if(!node) return;

        if(!node.left && !node.right) {
            result.add(node.val);
            return;
        }

        getLeaves(node.left, result);
        getLeaves(node.right, result);
    }

    void getRightBoundary(TreeNode node, int[] result) {
        if(!node || (!node.left && !node.right)) return;

        if(node.right) {
            getRightBoundary(node.right, result);
        } else {
            getRightBoundary(node.left, result);
        }

        result.add(node.val);
    }
}
```

## Detailed Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. Left Boundary Traversal
- Start from root's left child
- Always prefer left child if exists, otherwise go right
- Stop when reaching a leaf node
- Add nodes to result during traversal

### 2. Leaf Traversal
- Perform inorder traversal to get leaves from left to right
- Add only leaf nodes (nodes with no children)
- Skip non-leaf nodes

### 3. Right Boundary Traversal
- Start from root's right child
- Always prefer right child if exists, otherwise go left
- Stop when reaching a leaf node
- Add nodes to result **after** recursive calls (reverse order)

## Edge Cases Handling

1. **Empty Tree**: Return empty vector
2. **Single Node**: Return [root->val]
3. **Root is Leaf**: Only add root once
4. **No Left/Right Subtree**: Handle gracefully in boundary functions

## Complexity Analysis

| Aspect | Complexity | Explanation |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Time | O(n) | Visit each node exactly once |
| Space | O(h) | Recursion stack depth equals tree height |

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Leaf Check**: `!node->left && !node->right`
2. **Boundary Logic**: Prefer left/right child, fallback to other child
3. **Order Matters**: Left boundary → Leaves → Right boundary (reversed)
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Each node appears exactly once in result

## Follow-up Questions

- What if we need the boundary in clockwise direction?
- How would you handle duplicate values in the tree?
- What if we need to find the boundary of a general tree (not binary)?
