Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the **maximum sum** among all subarrays of length `k` that have **all distinct** elements. Return `0` if no such subarray exists.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: Subarrays of length 3 with distinct elements:
  [1,5,4] sum=10, [5,4,2] sum=11, [4,2,9] sum=15
  [2,9,9] has duplicate, [9,9,9] has duplicate
  Maximum = 15
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: [4,4,4] has duplicates, no valid subarray exists.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Thinking Process

### Two Constraints on the Window

The sliding window must satisfy:
1. **Length exactly `k`** -- standard fixed-size window
2. **All distinct elements** -- no duplicates inside

When a duplicate enters, we can't just shrink by one -- we must shrink past the **previous occurrence** of that duplicate to restore uniqueness.

### Algorithm

Use a hash map `numToIdx` tracking the last seen index of each element. For each new `end`:

1. Look up the last occurrence of `nums[end]`
2. Shrink `begin` past that occurrence (to remove the duplicate)
3. Also shrink if window exceeds size `k`
4. If window size equals `k`, update the answer

The running sum `currSum` is maintained incrementally as we shrink/expand.

### Walk-through

```
nums = [1, 5, 4, 2, 9, 9, 9], k = 3

end=0: [1]         currSum=1,  size=1
end=1: [1,5]       currSum=6,  size=2
end=2: [1,5,4]     currSum=10, size=3 → rtn=10
end=3: shrink(size>k) → [5,4,2]  currSum=11, size=3 → rtn=11
end=4: shrink(size>k) → [4,2,9]  currSum=15, size=3 → rtn=15
end=5: 9 seen at idx=4, shrink past 4 → [9]  currSum=9, size=1
end=6: 9 seen at idx=5, shrink past 5 → [9]  currSum=9, size=1

## Solution: Sliding Window + Hash Map -- $O(n)$

{% raw %}
```java
// import java.util.*;
class Solution {
    public long maximumSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        long rtn = 0, currSum = 0;
        int begin = 0, end = 0;

        HashMap<Integer, Integer> numToIdx = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        while (end < nums.length) {
            int currNum = nums[end];
            int lastOccur = (numToIdx.contains(currNum) ? numToIdx[currNum] : -1);
            while (begin <= lastOccur || end - begin + 1 > k) {
                currSum -= nums[begin];
                begin++;
            }
            numToIdx.put(currNum, end);
            currSum += nums[end];
            if (end - begin + 1 == k) {
                rtn = Math.max(rtn, currSum);
            }
            end++;
        }
        return rtn;
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(n)$ -- each element enters and leaves the window at most once
**Space**: $O(n)$ -- hash map

## Key Details

**Why `begin <= lastOccur` (not `<`)?** We need to move `begin` **past** the previous occurrence, so we shrink while `begin` is still at or before `lastOccur`.

**Why combine both conditions in one `while`?** A single shrink loop handles both constraints simultaneously:
- `end - begin + 1 > k` enforces the size limit
- `begin <= lastOccur` enforces uniqueness

**Why `long long`?** With $10^5$ elements each up to $10^5$, the sum can reach $10^{10}$.

## Common Mistakes

- Only checking window size without handling duplicates (misses the distinct constraint)
- Not updating `numToIdx` after shrinking (stale indices cause incorrect shrinks)
- Using a frequency map + separate duplicate counter instead of last-index tracking (works but more complex)

## Key Takeaways

- **"Fixed-size window + all distinct"** = sliding window with last-occurrence tracking
- Storing the **index** of the last occurrence (not just frequency) lets us jump `begin` directly past the duplicate
- The combined shrink condition handles both constraints elegantly in one loop
