# [Medium] 794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State

This is a simulation problem that requires understanding the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe and validating whether a given board state is possible. The key insight is checking the count of X's and O's, and ensuring that winning conditions are valid.

## Problem Description

Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as an array of strings, return whether this board state is valid.

A Tic-Tac-Toe board is valid if:
1. The number of X's and O's follows the game rules
2. Only one player can win
3. If X wins, there should be exactly one more X than O
4. If O wins, there should be equal number of X's and O's

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: board = ["O  ","   ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: board = ["XOX"," X ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: board = ["XXX","   ","OOO"]
Output: false
Explanation: Both players win at the same time.
```

### Constraints
- board.length == 3
- board[i].length == 3
- board[i][j] is either 'X', 'O', or ' '

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Game rules**: What are the tic-tac-toe rules? (Assumption: X goes first, players alternate, game ends when someone wins or board is full)

2. **Win condition**: How does a player win? (Assumption: Three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

3. **Valid state**: What makes a board state valid? (Assumption: State is reachable through valid gameplay - X count equals O count or X count = O count + 1)

4. **Multiple winners**: Can both players win simultaneously? (Assumption: No - per examples, if both win, state is invalid)

5. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Boolean - true if board state is valid, false otherwise)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to check if board is valid. Let me check all winning conditions and count pieces."

**Naive Solution**: Check all 8 winning lines (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals), count X's and O's, check if counts are valid.

**Complexity**: O(1) time, O(1) space

**Issues**:
- May miss edge cases
- Need to check multiple conditions
- Logic can be complex
- Need to handle all invalid cases

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I need to check: count difference (X - O should be 0 or 1), and at most one winner."

**Improved Solution**: Count X's and O's, check if difference is valid (0 or 1). Check all winning lines, ensure at most one winner. If X wins, count difference must be 1. If O wins, count difference must be 0.

**Complexity**: O(1) time, O(1) space

**Improvements**:
- Systematic checking of all conditions
- Handles all edge cases
- Clear logic flow
- O(1) time is optimal

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "The approach is already optimal. Let me refine the condition checking logic."

**Best Solution**: Check count difference first (must be 0 or 1). Then check winners: if both win, invalid. If X wins, must have count difference 1. If O wins, must have count difference 0.

**Complexity**: O(1) time, O(1) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Count difference check is first validation
2. Winner checking must consider count difference
3. O(1) time is optimal - fixed size board
4. All conditions must be checked systematically

## Approach

The solution involves checking several conditions:

1. **Count Validation**: Count X's and O's - X should have equal or one more count than O
2. **Win Detection**: Check if either player has won (rows, columns, diagonals)
3. **Win Validation**: 
   - If X wins, O should have exactly one less count than X
   - If O wins, X and O should have equal counts
   - Both players cannot win simultaneously

## Solution in Java

**Time Complexity:** O(1) - Constant time since board is always 3x3  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only using constant extra space

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validTicTacToe(String[] board) {
        int x_cnt = 0, o_cnt = 0;
        for (int i= 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (auto c : board[i]) {
                if (c == 'X') x_cnt++;
                if (c == 'O') o_cnt++;
            }
        }
        if (x_cnt != o_cnt + 1 && x_cnt != o_cnt) return false;
        boolean x_win = this.win(board, 'X');
        boolean o_win = this.win(board, 'O');
        if (x_win && o_cnt + 1 != x_cnt) return false;
        if (o_win && o_cnt != x_cnt) return false;
        if (x_win && o_win) return false;
        return true;
    }
    boolean win(String[] board, char P) {
        int n = board.size();
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i< n; i++) {
            cnt = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(board[i][j]== P) cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt == n) return true;

            cnt = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(board[j][i] == P) cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt == n) return true;
        }

        cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i< n; i++) {
            if(board[i][i] == P) cnt++;
        }
        if (cnt == n) return true;

        cnt = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if(board[i][n - i - 1] == P) cnt++;
        }
        if (cnt == n) return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the solution with board = `["XOX"," X ","OOO"]`:

**Step 1:** Count X's and O's
- X count: 3 (positions: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1))
- O count: 3 (positions: (0,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2))
- Check: `x_cnt != o_cnt + 1 && x_cnt != o_cnt` → `3 != 4 && 3 != 3` → `true && false` → `false` ✓

**Step 2:** Check for wins
- X wins: Check rows, columns, diagonals → No win for X
- O wins: Row 2 has all O's → O wins ✓

**Step 3:** Validate win conditions
- O wins and `o_cnt != x_cnt` → `3 != 3` → `false` ✓
- Both X and O don't win simultaneously ✓

**Result:** Valid board state

## Key Insights

1. **Turn Order**: X always goes first, so X should have equal or one more count than O
2. **Win Detection**: Check all rows, columns, and both diagonals
3. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Only one player can win in a valid game
4. **Count Validation**: Winning player must have the correct count based on game rules

## Common Mistakes

- Not checking if both players win simultaneously
- Incorrect count validation (allowing O to have more pieces than X)
- Missing diagonal win conditions
- Not handling edge cases like empty boards
