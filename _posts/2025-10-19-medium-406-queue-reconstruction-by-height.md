# [Medium] 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with exactly `ki` other people who have a height greater than or equal to `hi` in front of them.

Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no one taller or equal in front of them.
Person 1 has height 7 with no one taller or equal in front of them.
Person 2 has height 5 with two people taller or equal in front of them.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or equal in front of them.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or equal in front of them.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or equal in front of them.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 4 with no one taller or equal in front of them.
Person 1 has height 5 with no one taller or equal in front of them.
Person 2 has height 2 with two people taller or equal in front of them.
Person 3 has height 3 with two people taller or equal in front of them.
Person 4 has height 1 with four people taller or equal in front of them.
Person 5 has height 6 with no one taller or equal in front of them.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= people.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= hi <= 10^6`
- `0 <= ki < people.length`
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Person representation**: How are people represented? (Assumption: [height, k] where height is person's height, k is number of people taller or equal in front)

2. **Reconstruction rule**: What does k mean? (Assumption: k people with height >= current person's height must be in front)

3. **Uniqueness**: Is there a unique solution? (Assumption: Per problem statement, guaranteed to reconstruct - solution exists)

4. **Return format**: What should we return? (Assumption: Reconstructed queue - array of people in correct order)

5. **Tie-breaking**: How should we handle people with same height? (Assumption: People with same height count toward k - "taller or equal")

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to reconstruct queue. Let me try all possible orderings."

**Naive Solution**: Generate all possible permutations of people, check which satisfies all k constraints.

**Complexity**: O(n! × n²) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Factorial time complexity
- Checks many invalid orderings
- Very inefficient
- Doesn't leverage sorting property

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can sort by height first, then insert people based on k value."

**Improved Solution**: Sort people by height (descending), then by k (ascending). Insert each person at position k in result list.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Sorting reduces search space
- O(n²) time instead of factorial
- Greedy insertion is correct
- Handles all cases correctly

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Greedy sorting with insertion is optimal. Sorting ensures correct relative order."

**Best Solution**: Sort by height descending, then k ascending. Insert each person at index k. This works because taller people don't affect k of shorter people.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Sorting by height is key insight
2. Insertion at index k is correct
3. O(n²) time is optimal for insertion approach
4. Greedy approach works because of height ordering

## Solution: Greedy Sorting with List Insertion

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) where n is the number of people  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the result list

Sort people by height (descending) and k-value (ascending), then insert each person at the k-th position using a list for efficient insertion.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        /*
        1. Sort by height (descending), then by k-value (ascending)
        2. Insert each person at the k-th position
        3. Use list for efficient insertion at arbitrary positions
        */

        sort(people /* elements of people */, [](int[] a, int[] b) {
            if(a[0] == b[0]) return a[1] < b[1];  // Same height: sort by k-value
            return a[0] > b[0];                    // Different height: sort by height
        });

        list<int[]> rtn;
        for (int person : people) {
            var it = rtn.iterator();
            advance(it, person[1]);  // Move iterator to k-th position
            rtn.add(it, person);
        }

        return int[][](rtn /* elements of rtn */);
    }
}
```

## How the Algorithm Works

**Key Insight:** Sort people by height (descending) and k-value (ascending), then insert each person at the k-th position.

**Steps:**
1. **Sort people** by height (descending) and k-value (ascending)
2. **Use list** for efficient insertion at arbitrary positions
3. **For each person:**
   - Move iterator to k-th position
   - Insert person at that position
4. **Convert list** to vector and return

## Step-by-Step Example

### Example: `people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]`

**Step 1: Sort by height (descending) and k-value (ascending)**
```
Original: [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Sorted:   [[7,0],[7,1],[6,1],[5,0],[5,2],[4,4]]
```

**Step 2: Insert each person at k-th position**

| Person | Height | K | List State | Insertion Position |
|--------|--------|---|------------|-------------------|
| [7,0] | 7 | 0 | [] | Position 0 → [[7,0]] |
| [7,1] | 7 | 1 | [[7,0]] | Position 1 → [[7,0],[7,1]] |
| [6,1] | 6 | 1 | [[7,0],[7,1]] | Position 1 → [[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] |
| [5,0] | 5 | 0 | [[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] | Position 0 → [[5,0],[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] |
| [5,2] | 5 | 2 | [[5,0],[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] | Position 2 → [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[7,1]] |
| [4,4] | 4 | 4 | [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[7,1]] | Position 4 → [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] |

**Final result:** `[[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]`

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Sorting Logic:
```java
sort(people /* elements of people */, [](int[] a, int[] b) {
    if(a[0] == b[0]) return a[1] < b[1];  // Same height: sort by k-value
    return a[0] > b[0];                    // Different height: sort by height
});
```

**Process:**
1. **Primary sort:** By height (descending)
2. **Secondary sort:** By k-value (ascending) for same height
3. **Result:** Tallest people first, then by k-value

### Insertion Logic:
```java
for (int person : people) {
    var it = rtn.iterator();
    advance(it, person[1]);  // Move iterator to k-th position
    rtn.add(it, person);
}
```

**Process:**
1. **Start iterator** at beginning of list
2. **Advance iterator** to k-th position
3. **Insert person** at that position
4. **Repeat** for all people

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Sorting | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| Insertion | O(n²) | O(n) |
| **Total** | **O(n²)** | **O(n)** |

Where n is the number of people.

## Edge Cases

1. **Single person:** `people = [[5,0]]` → `[[5,0]]`
2. **All same height:** `people = [[5,0],[5,1],[5,2]]` → `[[5,0],[5,1],[5,2]]`
3. **All k=0:** `people = [[7,0],[6,0],[5,0]]` → `[[5,0],[6,0],[7,0]]`
4. **Maximum k:** `people = [[1,2]]` → `[[1,2]]`

## Key Insights

### Greedy Strategy:
1. **Tallest first:** Process tallest people first
2. **K-value ordering:** For same height, process by k-value
3. **Insertion order:** Insert at k-th position
4. **Optimal result:** Always produces correct reconstruction

### Why This Works:
1. **Tallest people:** Can be placed anywhere without affecting others
2. **K-value constraint:** Each person needs exactly k taller people in front
3. **Insertion order:** Maintains the constraint for all people
4. **List efficiency:** O(1) insertion at arbitrary positions

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

### Example: `people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]`

**Step 1: Sort by height (descending) and k-value (ascending)**
```
Original: [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Sorted:   [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
```

**Step 2: Insert each person at k-th position**

| Person | Height | K | List State | Insertion Position |
|--------|--------|---|------------|-------------------|
| [6,0] | 6 | 0 | [] | Position 0 → [[6,0]] |
| [5,0] | 5 | 0 | [[6,0]] | Position 0 → [[5,0],[6,0]] |
| [4,0] | 4 | 0 | [[5,0],[6,0]] | Position 0 → [[4,0],[5,0],[6,0]] |
| [3,2] | 3 | 2 | [[4,0],[5,0],[6,0]] | Position 2 → [[4,0],[5,0],[3,2],[6,0]] |
| [2,2] | 2 | 2 | [[4,0],[5,0],[3,2],[6,0]] | Position 2 → [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[6,0]] |
| [1,4] | 1 | 4 | [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[6,0]] | Position 4 → [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]] |

**Final result:** `[[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]`

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Vector with Insertion
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        sort(people /* elements of people */, [](int[] a, int[] b) {
            if(a[0] == b[0]) return a[1] < b[1];
            return a[0] > b[0];
        });

        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int person : people) {
            result.add(result.iterator() + person[1], person);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Approach 2: Priority Queue
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        for (int person : people) {
            pq.offer({person[0], person[1]});
        }

        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        while(!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] hpair = pq.peek(); int h = hpair[0]; int k = hpair[1];
            pq.poll();
            result.add(result.iterator() + k, new int[] {h, k});
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong sorting order:** Not sorting by height descending first
2. **Incorrect k-value handling:** Not considering k-value for same height
3. **Wrong insertion position:** Inserting at wrong index
4. **Data structure choice:** Using vector instead of list for insertion
