# 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Category:** Stack, Monotonic Stack

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Rectangle definition**: What rectangles can we form? (Assumption: Rectangles formed by consecutive bars - width is number of consecutive bars, height is minimum bar height)

2. **Rectangle area**: How is rectangle area calculated? (Assumption: width × height - number of bars × minimum bar height in range)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Maximum area among all possible rectangles)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer representing maximum rectangle area)

5. **Empty histogram**: What if histogram is empty? (Assumption: Per constraints, length >= 1, so not empty)

## Interview Deduction Process (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (8 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to find largest rectangle. Let me check all possible rectangles."

**Naive Solution**: For each bar, try all possible widths (extend left and right), compute area, track maximum.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(1) space

**Issues**:
- O(n²) time - inefficient
- Repeats work for finding boundaries
- Doesn't leverage monotonic stack
- Can be optimized

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (10 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use DP to find left and right boundaries where current bar is minimum."

**Improved Solution**: For each bar, find leftmost and rightmost positions where it's minimum. Use DP or two passes to compute boundaries.

**Complexity**: O(n²) worst case, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Better structure than brute-force
- Still O(n²) in worst case
- Can optimize boundary finding

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (12 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "I can use monotonic stack to find boundaries efficiently."

**Best Solution**: Use monotonic stack to find left and right boundaries where each bar is minimum. Stack stores indices. When bar is smaller than stack top, pop and compute area.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Monotonic stack is perfect for "next smaller" problems
2. O(n) time is optimal - each bar processed once
3. Stack efficiently finds boundaries
4. O(n) space for stack is necessary

## Approach

This is a classic **Monotonic Stack** problem. The key insight is that for each bar, we need to find the largest rectangle that can be formed with that bar as the height.

### Algorithm:
1. **Use a stack** to store indices of bars in increasing order of height
2. **For each bar**, pop all bars from stack that are taller than current bar
3. **Calculate area** for each popped bar using its height and the width it can extend
4. **Add a sentinel** (height 0) at the end to ensure all bars are processed
5. **Track maximum area** found so far

### Key Insight:
- For each bar at index `i`, the largest rectangle with height `heights[i]` extends from the previous smaller bar to the next smaller bar
- The width = `right_boundary - left_boundary - 1`

## Solution

```java
// import java.util.*;
class Solution {
        public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        int max_area = 0;
        heights.add(0);
        int n = heights.length;
        Deque<Integer> stk = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while(!stk.isEmpty() && heights[i] < heights[stk.peek()]) {
                int height = heights[stk.peek()];
                stk.poll();
                int width = stk.length == 0? i: i - stk.peek() - 1;
                max_area = Math.max(max_area, height width);
            }
            stk.offer(i);
        }
        return max_area;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Add Sentinel:** Append `0` to heights to ensure all bars are processed
2. **Initialize:** Empty stack and max_area = 0
3. **For each bar:**
   - **Pop taller bars:** While stack is not empty and current bar is shorter than stack top
   - **Calculate area:** For each popped bar, calculate area = height × width
   - **Update max:** Keep track of maximum area found
   - **Push current:** Add current index to stack

### Width Calculation:
- **If stack is empty:** Width extends from start to current position = `i`
- **If stack not empty:** Width extends from previous smaller bar to current = `i - stk.top() - 1`

### Example Walkthrough:
For `heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]` with sentinel `[2,1,5,6,2,3,0]`:

- **i=0, height=2:** Stack=[0]
- **i=1, height=1:** Pop 0, area=2×1=2, Stack=[1]
- **i=2, height=5:** Stack=[1,2]
- **i=3, height=6:** Stack=[1,2,3]
- **i=4, height=2:** Pop 3, area=6×1=6; Pop 2, area=5×2=10; Stack=[1,4]
- **i=5, height=3:** Stack=[1,4,5]
- **i=6, height=0:** Pop all, calculate remaining areas

**Maximum area = 10**

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of heights array
- Each element is pushed and popped from stack exactly once
- Each element is processed once

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack
- In worst case, all elements could be in increasing order

## Key Insights

1. **Monotonic Stack:** Maintains bars in increasing height order
2. **Sentinel Value:** Adding 0 at end ensures all bars are processed
3. **Area Calculation:** Width = distance between smaller bars on left and right
4. **Index Tracking:** Store indices in stack, not values, to calculate width
5. **Greedy Approach:** Process each bar as soon as we find a smaller bar

## Alternative Approaches

### Brute Force (O(n²)):
```java
static int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
    int max_area = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
        int min_height = heights[i];
        for(int j = i; j < heights.length; j++) {
            min_height = Math.min(min_height, heights[j]);
            max_area = Math.max(max_area, min_height * (j - i + 1));
        }
    }
    return max_area;
}
```

### Divide and Conquer (O(n log n)):
```java
static int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
    return divideConquer = new return(heights, 0, heights.length - 1);
}

static int divideConquer(int[] heights, int left, int right) {
    if(left > right) return 0;
    if(left == right) return heights[left];

    int min_idx = left;
    for(int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        if(heights[i] < heights[min_idx]) min_idx = i;
    }

    int area = heights[min_idx] * (right - left + 1);
    int left_area = divideConquer(heights, left, min_idx - 1);
    int right_area = divideConquer(heights, min_idx + 1, right);

    return Math.max({area, left_area, right_area});
}
```

The monotonic stack approach is the most efficient solution for this problem, demonstrating the power of this data structure for solving range-based problems.
