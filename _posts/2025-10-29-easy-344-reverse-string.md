# LC 344: Reverse String

Reverse the array of characters in-place using O(1) extra memory.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **In-place requirement**: Can we use extra space? (Assumption: O(1) extra memory only - cannot use additional array)

2. **Modification**: Should we modify the input array? (Assumption: Yes - reverse in-place, modify the original array)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Void - modify array in-place, no return value)

4. **Character set**: What characters can be in the array? (Assumption: Any characters - letters, digits, symbols)

5. **Empty array**: What if array is empty? (Assumption: No operation needed - empty array is already reversed)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to reverse string. Let me create new array with reversed order."

**Naive Solution**: Create new array, copy characters in reverse order from original array.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Uses O(n) extra space
- Not in-place as required
- Simple but doesn't meet constraint
- Can be optimized

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can swap characters from both ends, moving toward center."

**Improved Solution**: Use two pointers at start and end. Swap characters, move pointers inward until they meet.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Improvements**:
- O(1) space - true in-place reversal
- O(n) time is optimal
- Simple and efficient
- Handles all cases correctly

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Two-pointer approach is already optimal. No further optimization needed."

**Best Solution**: Two-pointer swap approach is optimal. Start with left=0, right=n-1, swap and move inward until left >= right.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Two-pointer technique is perfect for reversal
2. O(n) time is optimal - must process each character
3. O(1) space is optimal for in-place operation
4. Simple and elegant solution

## Approach

Two pointers at the ends swap characters and converge toward the center.
- Initialize `left=0`, `right=n-1`
- While `left < right`, swap `s[left]` with `s[right]`, then move inward

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0, right = (int)s.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;
            ++left;
            --right;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
