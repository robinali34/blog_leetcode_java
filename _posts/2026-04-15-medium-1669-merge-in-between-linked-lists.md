You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively. Remove `list1`'s nodes from the `a`-th node to the `b`-th node (0-indexed), and put `list2` in their place.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]

list1:  10 → 1 → 13 → [6 → 9] → 5
                        ↑ remove ↑
list2:  1000000 → 1000001 → 1000002

Result: 10 → 1 → 13 → 1000000 → 1000001 → 1000002 → 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
```

## Constraints

- `3 <= list1.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1`
- `1 <= list2.length <= 10^4`

The constraints guarantee `a >= 1` and `b < n - 1`, so there is always at least one node before `a` and one node after `b`.

## Thinking Process

### What Do We Need?

We're splicing `list2` into `list1` by removing positions `a..b`. That means three pointer rewirings:

```
prevA → list2_head → ... → list2_tail → afterB
```

We need:
1. **`prevA`** -- the node at index `a - 1` (just before the removed segment)
2. **`afterB`** -- the node at index `b + 1` (just after the removed segment)
3. **`tail2`** -- the last node of `list2`

### Why No Dummy Node Needed?

Since `a >= 1`, the head of `list1` is never removed, so we don't need a dummy node to protect the head.

### Walk-through

```
list1: 10 → 1 → 13 → 6 → 9 → 5     a=3, b=4
index:  0   1    2   3   4   5

Step 1: Walk to index a-1 = 2
  prevA = node(13)

Step 2: From prevA, walk (b - a + 1) more steps to reach node at index b
  then afterB = that node's next
  afterB = node(5)

Step 3: Find tail of list2
  list2: 1000000 → 1000001 → 1000002
  tail2 = node(1000002)

Step 4: Rewire
  prevA.next = list2         →  13 → 1000000
  tail2.next = afterB        →  1000002 → 5

Result: 10 → 1 → 13 → 1000000 → 1000001 → 1000002 → 5  ✓
```

## Solution: Pointer Manipulation -- $O(n + m)$ time, $O(1)$ space

{% raw %}
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeInBetween(ListNode list1, int a, int b, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode dummy(0);
        dummy.next = list1;

        ListNode prevA = &dummy;
        for (int i = 0; i < a; ++i) {
            prevA = prevA.next;
        }

        ListNode afterB = prevA;
        for (int i = 0; i <= b - a; ++i) {
            afterB = afterB.next;
        }
        afterB = afterB.next;

        prevA.next = list2;

        ListNode tail = list2;
        while (tail.next) {
            tail = tail.next;
        }
        tail.next = afterB;

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time:** $O(n + m)$ -- traverse `list1` up to index `b`, then traverse all of `list2`
**Space:** $O(1)$ -- only pointer variables

## Key Details

| Detail | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Why `dummy`? | Although the head is never removed (since `a >= 1`), using a dummy keeps the traversal logic uniform -- `prevA` starts at dummy and walks `a` steps |
| Finding `afterB` from `prevA` | Starting from `prevA` (index `a-1`), we walk `b - a + 1` steps to reach the node at index `b`, then one more `.next` to get `afterB` |
| Finding `tail2` separately | We can't assume anything about `list2`'s length, so we walk to its end |

## Without Dummy (Slightly Simpler)

Since the constraints guarantee `a >= 1`, we can skip the dummy:

{% raw %}
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeInBetween(ListNode list1, int a, int b, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode prevA = list1;
        for (int i = 0; i < a - 1; ++i) {
            prevA = prevA.next;
        }

        ListNode afterB = prevA;
        for (int i = 0; i <= b - a + 1; ++i) {
            afterB = afterB.next;
        }

        prevA.next = list2;

        ListNode tail = list2;
        while (tail.next) {
            tail = tail.next;
        }
        tail.next = afterB;

        return list1;
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

## Common Mistakes

- **Off-by-one on `prevA`:** Walking `a` steps from head lands on index `a`, but we need index `a - 1`. Use a dummy or walk `a - 1` steps.
- **Off-by-one on `afterB`:** Forgetting the final `.next` after reaching the node at index `b`.
- **Forgetting to find `tail2`:** The connection `list2_tail → afterB` is easy to miss if you only set `prevA → list2`.

## Key Takeaways

- **"Splice list into list"** = find the boundary pointers (`prevA`, `afterB`) + find the tail of the inserted list + three pointer rewirings
- When the head can never be removed, a dummy node is optional but can simplify uniform traversal
- Constraints like `a >= 1` and `b < n - 1` eliminate edge cases -- always read them carefully
