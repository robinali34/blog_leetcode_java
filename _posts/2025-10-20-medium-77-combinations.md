# 77. Combinations

## Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= k <= n`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Combination definition**: What is a combination? (Assumption: Selection of k elements from n elements, order doesn't matter - {1,2} same as {2,1})

2. **Element range**: What are the available elements? (Assumption: Numbers from 1 to n inclusive - [1, 2, ..., n])

3. **Output format**: Should we return all combinations or just count? (Assumption: Return all distinct combinations - list of lists)

4. **Order requirement**: Does the order of combinations matter? (Assumption: No - can return in any order, but typically lexicographic)

5. **Empty combination**: Should we include empty combination? (Assumption: No - k >= 1 per constraints, so no empty combinations)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Generate all possible subsets of size k from numbers 1 to n. Use nested loops or recursive generation of all combinations. This approach works but generates many invalid combinations and requires filtering, leading to exponential time complexity. The challenge is efficiently generating only valid combinations without duplicates.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use backtracking: build combinations incrementally. Start with an empty combination, and for each number, decide whether to include it or not. However, this still explores all possibilities. Better: use backtracking with constraint that we only consider numbers greater than the last chosen number (to avoid duplicates and maintain order). This prunes many invalid paths but still has exponential complexity in the worst case.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use backtracking with proper pruning: start from number 1, and for each position in the combination, try numbers from (last_chosen + 1) to n. This ensures combinations are generated in lexicographic order without duplicates. When the combination reaches size k, add it to results. Backtrack by removing the last element and trying the next number. This achieves optimal time complexity O(C(n,k) × k) where C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient, which is the best possible since we must generate all combinations. The key insight is maintaining the "start from last_chosen + 1" constraint to avoid duplicates and ensure proper ordering.

## Solution Approach

This problem asks for all possible combinations of `k` numbers from `[1, n]`. Since combinations are unordered (unlike permutations), we need to ensure we don't generate duplicate combinations.

### Key Insights:

1. **Order doesn't matter**: `[1,2]` and `[2,1]` are the same combination
2. **Avoid duplicates**: Start from `first_num` and only consider numbers after it
3. **Backtracking**: Use DFS to explore all possible combinations
4. **Pruning**: Stop when we have `k` elements in the current path

### Algorithm:

1. **DFS with backtracking**: Start from number 1 and explore all possible combinations
2. **Avoid duplicates**: For each position, only consider numbers greater than the previous number
3. **Base case**: When path size equals `k`, add to result
4. **Recursive case**: Try each number from `first_num` to `n`

## Solution

### **Solution: Backtracking with DFS**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] combine(int n, int k) {
        int[][] rtn;
        int[]path;
        dfs(n, k, path, 1, rtn);
        return rtn;
    }
    void dfs(int n, int k, int[] path, int first_num, int[][]& rtn) {
        if (path.size() == k) {
            rtn.add(path);
            return;
        }
        for(int i = first_num; i <= n; i++) {
            path.add(i);
            dfs(n, k, path, i + 1, rtn);
            path.removeLast();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize**: Start with empty `path` and `first_num = 1`
2. **Base case**: If `path.size() == k`, we have a valid combination
3. **Recursive case**: 
   - Try each number from `first_num` to `n`
   - Add current number to path
   - Recursively explore with `first_num = i + 1` (avoid duplicates)
   - Backtrack by removing the number from path

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `n = 4, k = 2`:**

```
dfs(4, 2, [], 1, result)
├── i=1: path=[1]
│   └── dfs(4, 2, [1], 2, result)
│       ├── i=2: path=[1,2] → result=[[1,2]]
│       ├── i=3: path=[1,3] → result=[[1,2],[1,3]]
│       └── i=4: path=[1,4] → result=[[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
├── i=2: path=[2]
│   └── dfs(4, 2, [2], 3, result)
│       ├── i=3: path=[2,3] → result=[[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3]]
│       └── i=4: path=[2,4] → result=[[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4]]
└── i=3: path=[3]
    └── dfs(4, 2, [3], 4, result)
        └── i=4: path=[3,4] → result=[[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
```

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O(C(n,k) × k)
- **Number of combinations**: C(n,k) = n! / (k! × (n-k)!)
- **Each combination**: Takes O(k) time to build
- **Total**: O(C(n,k) × k)

### **Space Complexity:** O(k)
- **Recursion depth**: O(k) - maximum depth of recursion
- **Path storage**: O(k) - stores current combination
- **Result storage**: O(C(n,k) × k) - not counted in auxiliary space

## Key Points

1. **Backtracking**: Use DFS with backtracking to explore all combinations
2. **Avoid duplicates**: Start from `first_num` and only consider larger numbers
3. **Efficient pruning**: Stop when path size equals k
4. **Order preservation**: Combinations are generated in lexicographical order
