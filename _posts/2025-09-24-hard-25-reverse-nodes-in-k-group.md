# [Hard] 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

This is a complex linked list problem that requires reversing nodes in groups of k. The key insight is using recursion to handle the grouping and a helper function to reverse individual groups.

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

- k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list
- If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k, then left-out nodes should remain as-is
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only the nodes themselves

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is n
- 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **K-group definition**: What does "reverse nodes in k-group" mean? (Assumption: Reverse every k consecutive nodes - if k=3, reverse first 3, then next 3, etc.)

2. **Remaining nodes**: What if remaining nodes are less than k? (Assumption: Leave them as is - don't reverse if fewer than k nodes remain)

3. **In-place modification**: Should we modify the list in-place? (Assumption: Yes - modify the existing list, return head of modified list)

4. **K value**: What is the range of k? (Assumption: 1 <= k <= n, where n is number of nodes)

5. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Head of the modified linked list)

## Interview Deduction Process (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (8 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to reverse nodes in k-groups. Let me collect values, rearrange, rebuild list."

**Naive Solution**: Collect all node values, rearrange in k-groups, rebuild linked list.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Uses O(n) extra space
- Modifies values instead of pointers
- Not truly in-place
- Doesn't demonstrate pointer manipulation

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (10 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can reverse k nodes at a time by manipulating pointers. Need to track group boundaries."

**Improved Solution**: Traverse list, reverse each group of k nodes by manipulating pointers. Track previous group's tail to connect groups.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Improvements**:
- O(1) space - true in-place operation
- Manipulates pointers directly
- Handles group boundaries correctly
- More complex than simple reversal

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (12 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Recursive or iterative approach. Recursive is cleaner, iterative is more space-efficient."

**Best Solution**: Recursive approach: reverse first k nodes, recursively reverse remaining list, connect. Iterative approach: use loop to process each group, reverse and connect.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n/k) space recursive, O(1) space iterative

**Key Realizations**:
1. Pointer manipulation is key skill
2. Group boundary handling is crucial
3. Recursive is cleaner but uses stack space
4. Iterative is more space-efficient

## Approach

The solution uses a recursive approach:

1. **Count Check**: Verify if there are at least k nodes remaining
2. **Reverse Group**: Reverse the first k nodes using a helper function
3. **Recursive Call**: Recursively process the remaining list
4. **Connect Groups**: Link the reversed group with the result from recursion

## Solution in Java

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Each node is visited once  
**Space Complexity:** O(n/k) - Recursion stack depth

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() { this.val = 0; this.next = null; }
 *     ListNode(int x) { this.val = x; this.next = null; }
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode next) { this.val = x; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        ListNode ptr = head;
        while(count < k && ptr != null) {
            ptr = ptr.next;
            count++;
        }
        if(count == k) {
            ListNode reversedHead = this.reverseLinkedList(head, k);
            head.next = this.reverseKGroup(ptr, k);
            return reversedHead;
        }
        return head;
    }
    ListNode reverseLinkedList(ListNode head, int k){
        ListNode new_head = null;
        ListNode ptr = head;
        while(k > 0) {
            ListNode next_node = ptr.next;
            ptr.next = new_head;
            new_head = ptr;
            ptr = next_node;
            k--;
        }
        return new_head;
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the solution with head = `[1,2,3,4,5]` and k = 2:

**Step 1:** Check if we have at least 2 nodes
- Count = 2, ptr points to node 3
- We have enough nodes, proceed with reversal

**Step 2:** Reverse first group [1,2]
- `reverseLinkedList([1,2], 2)` returns [2,1]
- new_head = 2, head = 1

**Step 3:** Recursive call on remaining list
- `reverseKGroup([3,4,5], 2)` processes the rest
- This will reverse [3,4] to [4,3] and leave [5] as-is

**Step 4:** Connect the groups
- head->next (which is 1) points to the result from recursion
- Final result: [2,1,4,3,5]

## Key Insights

1. **Recursive Structure**: Each group is processed independently
2. **Count Validation**: Always check if there are enough nodes before reversing
3. **Pointer Management**: Careful handling of head pointers and connections
4. **Base Case**: Return original head if insufficient nodes remain

## Helper Function Breakdown

The `reverseLinkedList` function:
1. **Iterative Reversal**: Reverses exactly k nodes
2. **Pointer Swapping**: Uses three pointers for safe reversal
3. **Count Control**: Uses k counter to limit reversal to exactly k nodes

## Edge Cases

- **k = 1**: No reversal needed, return original list
- **k = n**: Reverse entire list once
- **Insufficient Nodes**: Return remaining nodes unchanged
- **Empty List**: Handle null head gracefully

## Common Mistakes

- **Incorrect Count Check**: Not verifying enough nodes before reversal
- **Pointer Confusion**: Mixing up head pointers after reversal
- **Infinite Recursion**: Not properly handling base cases
- **Connection Errors**: Not properly linking reversed groups
