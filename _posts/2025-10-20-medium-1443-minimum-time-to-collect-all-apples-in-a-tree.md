# 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Tree, DFS, BFS, Graph

## Problem Statement

Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple; otherwise, vertex `i` does not have any apple.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
Output: 8
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai < bi < n`
- `fromi < toi`
- `hasApple.length == n`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Tree structure**: What is the tree structure? (Assumption: Undirected tree with n nodes, edges connect nodes - standard tree)

2. **Apple collection**: How do we collect apples? (Assumption: Must visit nodes with apples - hasApple[i] = true means node i has apple)

3. **Time calculation**: How is time calculated? (Assumption: 2 seconds per edge traversed - need to count unique edges)

4. **Starting position**: Where do we start? (Assumption: Start at node 0 - root of the tree)

5. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Minimum time in seconds to collect all apples and return to start)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to collect all apples. Let me try all possible paths."

**Naive Solution**: Try all possible paths to collect apples, find minimum time path.

**Complexity**: Exponential time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Exponential time complexity
- Tries many redundant paths
- Very inefficient
- Doesn't leverage tree structure

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use DFS to traverse tree, only visit subtrees that contain apples."

**Improved Solution**: Use DFS to traverse tree. For each node, check if subtree contains apples. If yes, must visit that subtree. Count edges that need to be traversed.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- DFS naturally traverses tree
- Only visits necessary subtrees
- O(n) time is optimal
- Handles all cases correctly

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "DFS approach is optimal. Count edges that need traversal (subtrees with apples)."

**Best Solution**: DFS approach is optimal. For each node, check if subtree has apples. If subtree has apples, must traverse edge to that subtree. Return 2 × number of edges that need traversal.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. DFS is natural for tree problems
2. Only traverse edges to subtrees with apples
3. O(n) time is optimal - visit each node once
4. Each edge traversed twice (to and from)

## Approach

This problem can be solved using either **DFS** or **BFS** approaches. The key insight is that we only need to visit subtrees that contain apples or lead to apples.

### DFS Approach (Optimal):
1. **Build adjacency list** from edges
2. **DFS from root (0)** with parent tracking to avoid cycles
3. **For each subtree**, calculate time needed if it contains apples
4. **Return total time** including 2 seconds per edge (going and coming back)

### BFS Approach:
1. **Build adjacency list** and **parent mapping** using BFS
2. **For each apple node**, trace path back to root
3. **Count edges** in the path, avoiding duplicates
4. **Return total time** (2 seconds per unique edge)

## Solution

### Approach 1: DFS (Optimal)

```java
class Solution {
        public int dfs(int[][] adj, boolean[] hasApple, int node, int parent) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        for (char child : adj[node].toCharArray()) {
            if(child == parent) continue;
            int childTime = dfs(adj, hasApple, child, node);
            if(childTime > 0 || hasApple[child]) totalTime += childTime + 2;
        }
        return totalTime;
    }
        public int minTime(int n, int[][] edges, boolean[] hasApple) {
        int[][] adj(n);
        for (int edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        return dfs = new return(adj, hasApple, 0, -1);
    }
}
```

### Approach 2: BFS with Path Tracing

```java
// import java.util.*;
class Solution {
        public int minTime(int n, int[][] edges, boolean[] hasApple) {
        public int[][] adj(n);
        for (int e : edges) {
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }

        int[]parent(n, -1);
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(0);
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        visited[0] = true;
        while(!q.isEmpty()) {
            int node = q.get(0);
            q.poll();
            for(int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                if(!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    parent[neighbor] = node;
                    q.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        HashSet<Integer> visitedNodes = new HashSet<Integer>();
        int time = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(!hasApple[i]) continue;
            int curr = i;
            while(curr != 0 && !visitedNodes.containsKey(curr)) {
                visitedNodes.add(curr);
                time += 2;
                curr = parent[curr];
            }
        }
        return time;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### DFS Approach (Recommended):

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Build adjacency list** from edges (undirected graph)
2. **DFS from root (0)** with parent parameter to avoid cycles
3. **For each child subtree:**
   - Calculate time needed for that subtree
   - If subtree has apples OR contains apples, add `childTime + 2`
   - The `+2` accounts for going to subtree and coming back
4. **Return total time** for current subtree

**Key Insight:** We only visit edges that lead to apples or are on the path to apples.

### BFS Approach:

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Build adjacency list** and **parent mapping** using BFS
2. **For each apple node**, trace path back to root
3. **Count unique edges** in the path (avoid duplicates)
4. **Return total time** (2 seconds per unique edge)

**Key Insight:** We trace paths from each apple back to root and count unique edges.

### Example Walkthrough (DFS):
For `n=7, edges=[[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple=[false,false,true,false,true,true,false]`:

- **DFS(0):** Check children 1, 2
- **DFS(1):** Check children 4, 5
  - **DFS(4):** hasApple[4]=true, return 0+2=2
  - **DFS(5):** hasApple[5]=true, return 0+2=2
  - **DFS(1):** return 2+2+2=6
- **DFS(2):** Check children 3, 6
  - **DFS(3):** hasApple[3]=false, return 0
  - **DFS(6):** hasApple[6]=false, return 0
  - **DFS(2):** return 0
- **DFS(0):** return 6+0=6, but hasApple[2]=true, so return 6+2=8

## Complexity Analysis

### DFS Approach:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - each node visited once
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - adjacency list + recursion stack

### BFS Approach:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - BFS + path tracing
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - adjacency list + parent array + visited set

## Which Approach is More Optimal?

**DFS Approach is more optimal** for the following reasons:

1. **Single Pass:** DFS solves the problem in one traversal
2. **No Extra Data Structures:** Doesn't need parent array or visited set
3. **Cleaner Logic:** Directly calculates time during traversal
4. **Better Space Usage:** Only uses recursion stack vs multiple arrays
5. **More Intuitive:** Naturally handles the tree structure

**BFS Approach Trade-offs:**
- **Two Passes:** Requires BFS + path tracing
- **More Memory:** Uses parent array and visited set
- **Complex Logic:** More complex path tracing logic

## Key Insights

1. **Tree Structure:** Undirected tree with n-1 edges
2. **Edge Cost:** Each edge costs 2 seconds (going + coming back)
3. **Optimal Path:** Only visit edges that lead to apples
4. **DFS Advantage:** Natural fit for tree traversal problems
5. **Parent Tracking:** Essential to avoid cycles in undirected graph

## Alternative Approaches

### Iterative DFS:
```java
static int minTime(int n, int[][] edges, boolean[] hasApple) {
    int[][] adj(n);
    for (int edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    stack<int[]> stk; // new int[] {node, parent}
    stk.offer({0, -1});
    int[] subtreeTime = new int[n];

    while(!stk.isEmpty()) {
        int[] nodepair = stk.peek(); int node = nodepair[0]; int parent = nodepair[1];
        stk.poll();

        // Process children
        for(int child : adj[node]) {
            if(child != parent) {
                stk.offer(new int[] {child, node});
            }
        }
    }

    return subtreeTime[0];
}
```

The **DFS approach is the most optimal** solution for this problem, providing the best balance of time complexity, space efficiency, and code clarity.
