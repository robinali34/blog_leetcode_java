There are `n` rooms labeled `0` to `n-1`. All rooms are locked except room `0`. Each room contains a set of keys to other rooms. Given `rooms[i]` -- the set of keys in room `i` -- return `true` if you can visit **all** rooms.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: Room 0 → key 1 → Room 1 → key 2 → Room 2 → key 3 → Room 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: Room 2 is never reachable.
```

## Constraints

- `n == rooms.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`
- `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n`
- All values of `rooms[i]` are unique

## Thinking Process

### Graph Abstraction

Each room is a **node** and each key is a **directed edge** to another room. Starting from room 0, can we reach all nodes?

This is a **graph reachability** problem -- standard DFS or BFS from a starting node.

### Algorithm

1. Start from room 0
2. Traverse reachable rooms using DFS or BFS
3. Track visited rooms
4. If `visited.size() == n`, all rooms are reachable

## Approach 1: DFS (Stack) -- $O(V + E)$

{% raw %}
```java
// import java.util.*;
class Solution {
        public boolean canVisitAllRooms(int[][] rooms) {
        int n = rooms.size();
        HashSet<Integer> visited = new HashSet<Integer>();
        Deque<Integer> st = new ArrayDeque<>();

        visited.add(0);
        st.offer(0);

        while (!st.isEmpty()) {
            int room = st.peek();
            st.poll();

            for (int key : rooms[room]) {
                if (!visited.contains(key)) {
                    visited.add(key);
                    st.offer(key);
                }
            }
        }

        return visited.length == n;
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(V + E)$ where $V$ = rooms, $E$ = total keys
**Space**: $O(V)$

## Approach 2: BFS (Queue) -- $O(V + E)$

{% raw %}
```java
// import java.util.*;
class Solution {
        public boolean canVisitAllRooms(int[][] rooms) {
        int n = rooms.size();
        HashSet<Integer> visited = new HashSet<Integer>();
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();

        visited.add(0);
        q.offer(0);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int room = q.get(0);
            q.poll();

            for (int key : rooms[room]) {
                if (!visited.contains(key)) {
                    visited.add(key);
                    q.offer(key);
                }
            }
        }

        return visited.length == n;
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(V + E)$
**Space**: $O(V)$

## Common Mistakes

- Starting with all rooms as "visitable" instead of just room 0
- Not marking rooms as visited when adding to the stack/queue (causes duplicates)
- Treating this as an undirected graph (keys are one-way: having key to room 3 doesn't mean room 3 has a key back)

## Key Takeaways

- **"Can we reach all nodes from a source?"** = graph reachability = DFS or BFS
- The rooms/keys metaphor maps directly to an adjacency list: `rooms[i]` is the neighbor list for node `i`
- Both DFS and BFS give the same result here since we only care about reachability, not shortest path
