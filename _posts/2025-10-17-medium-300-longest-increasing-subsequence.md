# [Medium] 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,18], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [0,1,2,3], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [7], therefore the length is 1.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Subsequence definition**: What is a subsequence? (Assumption: Sequence that maintains relative order but doesn't need to be contiguous - can skip elements)

2. **Increasing definition**: What makes a subsequence increasing? (Assumption: Strictly increasing - each element must be greater than the previous one)

3. **Return value**: Should we return the subsequence or just length? (Assumption: Return length - integer representing longest increasing subsequence length)

4. **Duplicate values**: How should we handle duplicate values? (Assumption: Based on "increasing", duplicates don't count - need strictly greater values)

5. **Empty array**: What if array is empty? (Assumption: Return 0 - no subsequence exists)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to find longest increasing subsequence. Let me try all possible subsequences."

**Naive Solution**: Generate all possible subsequences, check if each is increasing, track maximum length.

**Complexity**: O(2^n × n) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Exponential time complexity
- Generates many invalid subsequences
- Very inefficient
- Doesn't leverage optimal substructure

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "This has optimal substructure. Length of LIS ending at i depends on LIS ending at previous positions."

**Improved Solution**: Use DP where dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i. For each i, check all previous positions j where nums[j] < nums[i], take maximum dp[j] + 1.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Leverages optimal substructure
- O(n²) time instead of exponential
- Correctly finds LIS length
- Can be optimized further

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "I can use binary search with patience sorting to achieve O(n log n) time."

**Best Solution**: Use binary search with patience sorting. Maintain array of smallest tail values for each LIS length. For each number, find position to replace using binary search. This achieves O(n log n) time.

**Complexity**: O(n log n) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. DP is natural approach but O(n²)
2. Binary search optimization achieves O(n log n)
3. Patience sorting is key technique
4. O(n log n) time is optimal

## Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Use dynamic programming to track the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int[]dp(nums.length, -1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        int rtn = 1;

        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int max_pre = 0;
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if(nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    max_pre = Math.max(max_pre, dp[j]);
                }
            }
            dp[i] = max_pre + 1;
            rtn = Math.max(rtn, dp[i]);
        }

        return rtn;
    }
}
```

## Solution 2: Binary Search with Patience Sorting

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Use binary search to maintain a sorted array representing the smallest tail element of all increasing subsequences of different lengths.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int[]sub;
        sub.add(nums[0]);

        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int num = nums[i];
            if(num > sub.getLast()) {
                sub.add(num);
            } else {
                var it = binary search (lower bound)(sub /* elements of sub */, num);
                *it = num;
            }
        }

        return sub.size();
    }
}
```

## How the Algorithms Work

### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming Approach

**Key Insight:** For each position `i`, find the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i` by checking all previous positions.

**Steps:**
1. **Initialize DP array** with `dp[0] = 1`
2. **For each position `i`**, check all previous positions `j`
3. **If `nums[i] > nums[j]`**, update `max_pre` with `dp[j]`
4. **Set `dp[i] = max_pre + 1`** and update global maximum

### Solution 2: Binary Search Approach

**Key Insight:** Maintain an array where `sub[i]` represents the smallest tail element of all increasing subsequences of length `i+1`.

**Steps:**
1. **Initialize** with first element
2. **For each element**, if it's larger than last element, append it
3. **Otherwise**, use binary search to find position and replace
4. **Return** the size of the maintained array

## Step-by-Step Examples

### Solution 1 Example: `nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

| i | nums[i] | Check j | max_pre | dp[i] | rtn |
|---|---------|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| 0 | 10 | - | - | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 9 | j=0: 9≤10 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | j=0,1: 2≤10,9 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 5 | j=0,1,2: 5≤10, 5≤9, 5>2 | dp[2]=1 | 2 | 2 |
| 4 | 3 | j=0,1,2,3: 3≤10, 3≤9, 3>2, 3≤5 | dp[2]=1 | 2 | 2 |
| 5 | 7 | j=0,1,2,3,4: 7≤10, 7≤9, 7>2, 7>5, 7>3 | max(dp[2],dp[3],dp[4])=2 | 3 | 3 |
| 6 | 101 | j=0,1,2,3,4,5: 101>10, 101>9, 101>2, 101>5, 101>3, 101>7 | max(dp[0],dp[1],dp[2],dp[3],dp[4],dp[5])=3 | 4 | 4 |
| 7 | 18 | j=0,1,2,3,4,5,6: 18>10, 18>9, 18>2, 18>5, 18>3, 18>7, 18≤101 | max(dp[0],dp[1],dp[2],dp[3],dp[4],dp[5])=3 | 4 | 4 |

**Final result:** 4

### Solution 2 Example: `nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

| i | nums[i] | sub | Action |
|---|---------|-----|--------|
| 0 | 10 | [10] | Initialize |
| 1 | 9 | [9] | Replace 10 with 9 |
| 2 | 2 | [2] | Replace 9 with 2 |
| 3 | 5 | [2,5] | Append 5 |
| 4 | 3 | [2,3] | Replace 5 with 3 |
| 5 | 7 | [2,3,7] | Append 7 |
| 6 | 101 | [2,3,7,101] | Append 101 |
| 7 | 18 | [2,3,7,18] | Replace 101 with 18 |

**Final result:** 4

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

```java
int[]dp(nums.length, -1);
dp[0] = 1;
int rtn = 1;

for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    int max_pre = 0;
    for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        if(nums[i] > nums[j]) {
            max_pre = Math.max(max_pre, dp[j]);
        }
    }
    dp[i] = max_pre + 1;
    rtn = Math.max(rtn, dp[i]);
}
```

**Process:**
1. **Initialize** DP array with first element
2. **For each position**, check all previous positions
3. **Find maximum** length of subsequence ending at previous positions
4. **Update** current position and global maximum

### Solution 2: Binary Search

```java
int[]sub;
sub.add(nums[0]);

for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    int num = nums[i];
    if(num > sub.getLast()) {
        sub.add(num);
    } else {
        var it = binary search (lower bound)(sub /* elements of sub */, num);
        *it = num;
    }
}
```

**Process:**
1. **Initialize** with first element
2. **If current element** is larger than last, append it
3. **Otherwise**, find position using binary search and replace
4. **Return** size of maintained array

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Dynamic Programming | O(n²) | O(n) |
| Binary Search | O(n log n) | O(n) |

## Edge Cases

1. **Single element:** `nums = [1]` → `1`
2. **All same elements:** `nums = [7,7,7,7]` → `1`
3. **Decreasing sequence:** `nums = [5,4,3,2,1]` → `1`
4. **Increasing sequence:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]` → `5`

## Key Insights

### Solution 1 (DP):
1. **Subproblem:** Length of LIS ending at each position
2. **Overlapping subproblems:** Previous positions contribute to current
3. **Optimal substructure:** Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
4. **Bottom-up approach:** Build solution from smaller subproblems

### Solution 2 (Binary Search):
1. **Patience sorting:** Maintain smallest tail elements
2. **Binary search:** Efficiently find insertion position
3. **Greedy approach:** Always maintain smallest possible tail elements
4. **Length tracking:** Size of array equals LIS length

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong DP definition:** Not considering all previous positions
2. **Incorrect initialization:** Not setting `dp[0] = 1`
3. **Missing global maximum:** Not tracking maximum across all positions
4. **Binary search errors:** Wrong comparison in `binary search (lower bound)`

```
i | nums[i] | dp[i] | Explanation
0 | 0       | 1     | Base case
1 | 1       | 2     | Can extend from dp[0] (0 < 1)

```

**Final result:** 4

**Sub Array Evolution:**
```
i=0: [0]
i=1: [0,1]
i=2: [0,1] (0 ≤ 0, no change)
i=3: [0,1,3]
i=4: [0,1,2] (replace 3 with 2)
i=5: [0,1,2,3]
```

**Final result:** 4

### Solution 1: `nums = [0,8,4,12,2]`

**DP Table:**
```
i | nums[i] | Check j | max_pre | dp[i] | rtn | Explanation
0 | 0       | -       | -       | 1     | 1   | Base case
1 | 8       | j=0: 8>0| dp[0]=1 | 2     | 2   | Can extend from dp[0] (0 < 8)
2 | 4       | j=0: 4>0| dp[0]=1 | 2     | 2   | Can extend from dp[0] (0 < 4), cannot extend from dp[1] (4 ≤ 8)
3 | 12      | j=0: 12>0, j=1: 12>8, j=2: 12>4 | max(dp[0],dp[1],dp[2])=max(1,2,2)=2 | 3 | 3 | Can extend from dp[0], dp[1], dp[2] (0 < 12, 8 < 12, 4 < 12)
4 | 2       | j=0: 2>0, j=1: 2≤8, j=2: 2≤4, j=3: 2≤12 | dp[0]=1 | 2 | 3 | Can extend from dp[0] (0 < 2), cannot extend from others
```

**Final result:** 3 (LIS: [0,8,12] or [0,4,12])

### Solution 2: `nums = [0,8,4,12,2]`

**Important Note:** The `sub` array does **NOT** represent the actual LIS sequence. It only tracks the **smallest tail element** of all increasing subsequences of each length. This allows us to potentially extend subsequences in the future.

**Sub Array Evolution:**
```
i=0: [0]                    (Initialize: smallest tail for length 1)
i=1: [0,8]                  (8 > 0, append: smallest tail for length 2 is 8)
i=2: [0,4]                  (4 ≤ 8, replace 8 with 4: now smallest tail for length 2 is 4, which is better for future extensions)
i=3: [0,4,12]               (12 > 4, append: smallest tail for length 3 is 12)
i=4: [0,2,12]               (2 ≤ 4, replace 4 with 2: now smallest tail for length 2 is 2, which is even better)
```

**Key Insight:** 
- `sub[i]` = smallest tail element of all increasing subsequences of length `i+1`
- Replacing `4` with `2` doesn't mean the actual LIS is `[0,2,12]`
- The actual LIS could be `[0,8,12]` or `[0,4,12]` (both length 3)
- We replace to maintain the **smallest possible tail elements**, which allows future elements to extend subsequences more easily
- The **length** of `sub` (which is 3) gives us the LIS length, not the actual sequence

**Final result:** 3 (Length of sub array = LIS length)

### Solution 2: `nums = [3, 10, 20, 4, 5, 6]` - Middle Replacement Demo

This example demonstrates how the binary search approach replaces **middle elements** to maintain smaller tail values, enabling future extensions.

**Sub Array Evolution:**

```
i=0: [3]                    (Initialize: smallest tail for length 1 is 3)
i=1: [3,10]                 (10 > 3, append: smallest tail for length 2 is 10)
i=2: [3,10,20]              (20 > 10, append: smallest tail for length 3 is 20)
i=3: [3,4,20]               (4 ≤ 10, replace 10 with 4: now smallest tail for length 2 is 4)
                             Key: Replacing 10 with 4 doesn't break the sequence!
                             We still have length 3 subsequence [3,10,20] conceptually,
                             but we optimize by making length 2 tail smaller (4 instead of 10)
i=4: [3,4,5]                (5 ≤ 20, replace 20 with 5: now smallest tail for length 3 is 5)
                             Key: Replacing 20 with 5 makes length 3 tail smaller (5 instead of 20)
                             This allows future elements to extend more easily
i=5: [3,4,5,6]              (6 > 5, append: smallest tail for length 4 is 6)
                             Success! By replacing middle elements, we enabled 6 to extend
```

**Detailed Step-by-Step:**

| Step | nums[i] | sub before | Comparison | Action | sub after | Explanation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | 3 | [] | - | Initialize | [3] | Base case |
| 1 | 10 | [3] | 10 > 3 | Append | [3,10] | Extend length 2 |
| 2 | 20 | [3,10] | 20 > 10 | Append | [3,10,20] | Extend length 3 |
| 3 | 4 | [3,10,20] | 4 ≤ 10 | Replace `sub[1]` | [3,4,20] | **Middle replacement**: Replace 10 with 4 to make length 2 tail smaller |
| 4 | 5 | [3,4,20] | 5 ≤ 20 | Replace `sub[2]` | [3,4,5] | **Middle replacement**: Replace 20 with 5 to make length 3 tail smaller |
| 5 | 6 | [3,4,5] | 6 > 5 | Append | [3,4,5,6] | Extend length 4 (enabled by previous replacements!) |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Middle Replacement Strategy:**
   - At `i=3`: `4` replaces `10` at position 1 (middle of array)
   - At `i=4`: `5` replaces `20` at position 2 (middle of array)
   - These replacements don't break existing sequences; they optimize for future extensions

2. **Why Replace Middle Elements?**
   - Smaller tail values allow more future elements to extend the sequence
   - `4 < 10` means more numbers can come after `4` than after `10`
   - `5 < 20` means more numbers can come after `5` than after `20`

3. **The Actual LIS:**
   - The actual LIS is `[3,4,5,6]` (length 4)
   - The `sub` array at the end `[3,4,5,6]` happens to match the actual LIS
   - But this is coincidental - `sub` tracks smallest tails, not the actual sequence

4. **Binary Search in Action:**
   - `binary search (lower bound)([3,10,20], 4)` → finds position 1 (where 10 is)
   - `binary search (lower bound)([3,4,20], 5)` → finds position 2 (where 20 is)
   - Both replacements happen in the middle, not at the end

**Final result:** 4 (Length of sub array = LIS length)

**Visual Representation:**

```
Initial:  [3, 10, 20]
          └─┬─┘ └─┬─┘
            │     └─ Length 3 tail = 20
            └─ Length 2 tail = 10

After 4:  [3, 4, 20]
          └─┬─┘ └─┬─┘
            │     └─ Length 3 tail = 20 (unchanged)
            └─ Length 2 tail = 4 (replaced 10 with 4)

After 5:  [3, 4, 5]
          └─┬─┘ └─┬─┘
            │     └─ Length 3 tail = 5 (replaced 20 with 5)
            └─ Length 2 tail = 4 (unchanged)

After 6:  [3, 4, 5, 6]
          └─┬─┘ └─┬─┘ └─┘
            │     │     └─ Length 4 tail = 6 (new!)
            │     └─ Length 3 tail = 5 (unchanged)
            └─ Length 2 tail = 4 (unchanged)
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Recursive with Memoization
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int[]memo(nums.length, -1);
        int maxLen = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, dfs(nums, i, memo));
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
    int dfs(int[] nums, int index, int[] memo) {
        if(memo[index] != -1) return memo[index];

        int maxLen = 1;
        for(int i = index + 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] > nums[index]) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, 1 + dfs(nums, i, memo));
            }
        }

        memo[index] = maxLen;
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Solution 1 (DP):
1. **Correct recurrence:** `dp[i] = max(dp[j]) + 1` for all `j < i` where `nums[j] < nums[i]`
2. **Optimal substructure:** LIS ending at position `i` contains LIS ending at some `j < i`
3. **Complete search:** Checks all possible previous positions
4. **Efficient for small inputs:** O(n²) is acceptable for n ≤ 2500

### Solution 2 (Binary Search):
1. **Patience sorting:** Maintains smallest tail elements correctly
2. **Binary search optimization:** O(log n) per element instead of O(n)
3. **Greedy correctness:** Always maintains optimal tail elements
4. **Optimal complexity:** O(n log n) is optimal for this problem
