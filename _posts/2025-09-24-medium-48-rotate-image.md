# [Medium] 48. Rotate Image

This is a matrix manipulation problem that requires rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place. The key insight is understanding the relationship between matrix positions during rotation and implementing it efficiently.

## Problem Description

Given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise in-place.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

### Constraints
- n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 20
- -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Rotation direction**: Which direction should we rotate? (Assumption: Clockwise 90 degrees - typical matrix rotation)

2. **Matrix type**: Is the matrix square? (Assumption: Yes - per constraints, n x n matrix)

3. **In-place modification**: Should we modify the matrix in-place? (Assumption: Yes - modify matrix in-place, O(1) extra space)

4. **Rotation angle**: What is the rotation angle? (Assumption: 90 degrees clockwise - standard matrix rotation)

5. **Element movement**: How do elements move? (Assumption: Element at (i, j) moves to (j, n-1-i) after 90° clockwise rotation)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to rotate matrix. Let me create new matrix and copy elements to new positions."

**Naive Solution**: Create new matrix, copy each element from (i, j) to (j, n-1-i) in new matrix.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(n²) space

**Issues**:
- Uses O(n²) extra space
- Not in-place as required
- Simple but doesn't meet space constraint

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can rotate in-place by swapping elements in cycles. Each element moves in a 4-cycle."

**Improved Solution**: Rotate in cycles of 4 elements. For each cycle, swap elements: (i,j) → (j,n-1-i) → (n-1-i,n-1-j) → (n-1-j,i) → (i,j).

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(1) space

**Improvements**:
- O(1) space - true in-place rotation
- Handles all elements correctly
- More complex than transpose approach

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Transpose + reflect is more intuitive than cycle rotation."

**Best Solution**: Two-step approach: transpose matrix (swap (i,j) with (j,i)), then reflect each row (reverse each row). This is more intuitive than cycle rotation.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(1) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Transpose + reflect is elegant approach
2. O(n²) time is optimal - must process each element
3. O(1) space is optimal for in-place rotation
4. Two-step approach is clearer than cycle rotation

## Approach

There are two main approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Direct Rotation**: Rotate elements in groups of 4 using coordinate mapping
2. **Transpose + Reflect**: Transpose the matrix then reflect each row

## Solution 1: Direct Rotation

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) - Visit each element once  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only using constant extra space

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int tmp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
                matrix[j][i] = tmp;
            }
        }
        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            for (int l = 0, r = row.length - 1; l < r; l++, r--) {
                int tmp = row[l];
                row[l] = row[r];
                row[r] = tmp;
            }
        }
    }
}```

## Solution 2: Transpose + Reflect

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) - Visit each element twice  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only using constant extra space

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        transpose(matrix);
        reflect(matrix);
    }
    public void transpose(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                swap(matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    public void reflect(int[][] matrix) {
        for (int row : matrix) {
            reverse(row /* elements of row */);
        }
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through Solution 2 with matrix = `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`:

**Step 1: Transpose**
```
Original:  [1,2,3]    Transposed:  [1,4,7]
           [4,5,6]                 [2,5,8]
           [7,8,9]                 [3,6,9]
```

**Step 2: Reflect (reverse each row)**
```
Transposed: [1,4,7]    Reflected:   [7,4,1]
            [2,5,8]                [8,5,2]
            [3,6,9]                [9,6,3]
```

**Result:** `[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]`

## Coordinate Mapping (Solution 1)

For a 90° clockwise rotation, the coordinate transformation is:
- `(i, j) → (j, n-1-i)`

The four positions that rotate together:
1. `(i, j)` → `(j, n-1-i)`
2. `(j, n-1-i)` → `(n-1-i, n-1-j)`
3. `(n-1-i, n-1-j)` → `(n-1-j, i)`
4. `(n-1-j, i)` → `(i, j)`

## Key Insights

1. **In-Place Rotation**: Must modify the original matrix without extra space
2. **Group of 4**: Each element participates in a cycle of 4 positions
3. **Boundary Handling**: Careful with odd/even matrix sizes
4. **Mathematical Approach**: Transpose + reflect is more intuitive

## Solution Comparison

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Direct Rotation** | Single pass, efficient | Complex coordinate mapping |
| **Transpose + Reflect** | Intuitive, easier to understand | Two passes through matrix |

## Matrix Size Considerations

- **Even n**: Process all n²/4 groups
- **Odd n**: Process (n²-1)/4 groups (center element stays unchanged)

## Common Mistakes

- **Coordinate Errors**: Incorrect mapping formulas
- **Boundary Issues**: Not handling odd matrix sizes correctly
- **Over-rotation**: Processing the same elements multiple times
- **Index Confusion**: Mixing up row and column indices
