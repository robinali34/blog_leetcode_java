You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock on day `i`. Find the maximum profit with as many transactions as you like, subject to: after you sell, you must **cooldown for one day** before buying again.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: buy→sell→cooldown→buy→sell = (2-1) + (2-0) = 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

## Thinking Process

### State Machine DP

On any day we're in exactly one of three states:

```
        buy
  ┌──────────────┐
  ▼              │
hold ──sell──► rest ──idle──► sold
  │                            │
  └────────keep────────────────┘
              idle
```

- **hold**: we own a stock (either bought today or carried from yesterday)
- **rest**: we just sold (cooldown -- cannot buy tomorrow)
- **sold**: we don't own a stock and are free to buy (either stayed idle or finished cooldown)

### Transitions

$$\text{hold}[i] = \max(\text{hold}[i-1],\ \text{sold}[i-1] - \text{prices}[i])$$

Keep holding, or buy today (only from `sold` state, not from `rest`).

$$\text{rest}[i] = \text{hold}[i-1] + \text{prices}[i]$$

Sell today (transition from `hold` to `rest`).

$$\text{sold}[i] = \max(\text{sold}[i-1],\ \text{rest}[i-1])$$

Stay idle, or cooldown finished (transition from `rest` to `sold`).

### Base Case

Day 0: `hold = -prices[0]`, `sold = 0`, `rest = 0`

### Answer

$\max(\text{sold}, \text{rest})$ -- we either have no stock and are free, or we just sold. We never want to end in `hold`.

### Walk-through

```
prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]

Day 0: hold=-1, sold=0, rest=0
Day 1: hold=max(-1, 0-2)=-1, sold=max(0, 0)=0, rest=-1+2=1
Day 2: hold=max(-1, 0-3)=-1, sold=max(0, 1)=1, rest=-1+3=2
Day 3: hold=max(-1, 1-0)=1,  sold=max(1, 2)=2, rest=-1+0=-1
Day 4: hold=max(1, 2-2)=1,   sold=max(2, -1)=2, rest=1+2=3

Answer: max(sold=2, rest=3) = 3 ✓
```

## Solution: State Machine DP -- $O(n)$

{% raw %}
```java
class Solution {
        public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        int hold = -prices[0];
        int sold = 0;
        int rest = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int pre_hold = hold;
            int pre_sold = sold;
            int pre_rest = rest;
            hold = Math.max(pre_hold, pre_sold - prices[i]);
            sold = Math.max(pre_sold, pre_rest);
            rest = pre_hold + prices[i];
        }
        return Math.max(sold, rest);
    }
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(n)$ -- single pass
**Space**: $O(1)$ -- three variables

## Why Save `pre_` Values?

All three states depend on the **previous day's** values. If we update `hold` first, it would corrupt the computation of `rest` (which needs the old `hold`). Saving previous values ensures all transitions use day $i-1$ consistently.

## Common Mistakes

- Allowing buy from `rest` state (violates the cooldown constraint)
- Forgetting to return `max(sold, rest)` -- selling on the last day (`rest`) can be optimal
- Not saving previous-day values before updating (order-dependent bug)

## Key Takeaways

- **Stock problems with constraints** map cleanly to state machine DP
- Three states (`hold`, `sold`, `rest`) capture the cooldown rule naturally
- Space optimization from $O(n)$ array to $O(1)$ variables is straightforward since each state only depends on the previous day

## Stock Problem Family

| Problem | Constraint | States |
|---|---|---|
| 121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | 1 transaction | `hold`, `sold` |
| 122 Best Time II | Unlimited | `hold`, `sold` |
| 123 Best Time III | At most 2 | `hold1`, `sold1`, `hold2`, `sold2` |
| 188 Best Time IV | At most k | `hold[j]`, `sold[j]` for $j \in [1,k]$ |
| **309 With Cooldown** | **Unlimited + cooldown** | **`hold`, `sold`, `rest`** |
| 714 With Transaction Fee | Unlimited + fee | `hold`, `sold` |
