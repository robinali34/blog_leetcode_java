You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement `NestedIterator`:
- `NestedIterator(vector<NestedInteger> &nestedList)` -- initializes the iterator
- `int next()` -- returns the next integer in the flattened list
- `bool hasNext()` -- returns `true` if there are still integers to iterate

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: Flattening gives [1,1,2,1,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nestedList.length <= 500`
- Values are in the range `[-10^6, 10^6]`
- At most `10^5` calls to `next` and `hasNext`

## Thinking Process

### The Problem with Pre-flattening

We could recursively flatten the entire list in the constructor and iterate over the result. That works, but uses $O(n)$ extra space upfront and doesn't take advantage of **lazy evaluation** -- we might not need all elements.

### Stack-Based Lazy Approach

Use a stack to simulate the recursive flattening on demand:

1. **Constructor**: push elements onto the stack **in reverse order** (so the first element is on top)
2. **`hasNext`**: peek at the top -- if it's a list, expand it (pop, push children in reverse). Repeat until the top is an integer or the stack is empty
3. **`next`**: the top is guaranteed to be an integer (since `hasNext` was called first) -- pop and return it

### Why Push in Reverse?

A stack is LIFO. To process elements left-to-right, we push them right-to-left:

```
nestedList = [A, B, C]
Push: C, B, A  →  stack top = A  ✓
```

### Walk-through

```
Input: [[1,1], 2, [1,1]]

Constructor: push [1,1], 2, [1,1] in reverse
  stack: [1,1] | 2 | [1,1]  (top → [1,1])

hasNext(): top = [1,1] → list, expand: push 1, 1
  stack: [1,1] | 2 | 1 | 1  (top → 1, integer ✓)
next(): return 1

hasNext(): top = 1 (integer ✓)
next(): return 1

hasNext(): top = 2 (integer ✓)
next(): return 2

hasNext(): top = [1,1] → list, expand: push 1, 1
  stack: 1 | 1  (top → 1 ✓)
next(): return 1

hasNext(): top = 1 (integer ✓)
next(): return 1

hasNext(): stack empty → false
```

## Solution: Stack-Based Lazy Iterator -- $O(1)$ amortized

{% raw %}
```java
// import java.util.*;
class NestedIterator {
    NestedIterator(NestedInteger[]nestedList) {
        for (int i = nestedList.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            stk.offer(nestedList[i]);
        }
    }

    int next() {
        int val = stk.peek().getInteger();
        stk.poll();
        return val;
    }

    boolean hasNext() {
        while (!stk.isEmpty()) {
            NestedInteger curr = stk.peek();
            if (curr.isInteger()) {
                return true;
            }
            stk.poll();
            var lst = curr.getList();
            for (int i = lst.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
                stk.offer(lst[i]);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    Deque<NestedInteger> stk = new ArrayDeque<>();
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(1)$ amortized per `next`/`hasNext` call -- each element is pushed and popped exactly once across all calls
**Space**: $O(D)$ where $D$ = maximum nesting depth (stack holds at most one "path" through the nesting)

## Key Details

**Why does `hasNext` do the flattening, not `next`?**
The iterator contract requires `hasNext` to correctly report whether more elements exist. If the top of the stack is a nested list (possibly empty), `hasNext` must drill down to find the next actual integer -- or determine there are none.

**What about empty nested lists like `[[], [1]]`?**
The `while` loop in `hasNext` handles this: `[]` gets popped and expanded to nothing, then the loop continues to process `[1]`.

## Common Mistakes

- Pushing elements in forward order (reverses the iteration order)
- Flattening in `next` instead of `hasNext` (breaks the contract when checking for empty nested lists)
- Not handling deeply nested empty lists like `[[[[]]]]`

## Key Takeaways

- **"Flatten a recursive structure lazily"** = stack-based iterator
- Push in reverse order to maintain left-to-right traversal with a LIFO stack
- Doing the expansion in `hasNext` rather than `next` correctly handles empty nested lists and satisfies the iterator contract
